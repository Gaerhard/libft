# libft
Libft project from school 42. The goal of the project is to recreate multiple functions
and then use these functions in the future projects.

### Installing
```
Run the make command
```

### Functions
* ft_abs returns the absolute of an int
* ft_atoi has the same behavior as atoi from the libc

* ft_lsdtdelone deletes a link frokm a list
* ft_lstfind returns the link from a list which contains the content sought
* ft_lstfront adds a new link to the begining of the list
* ft_lstiter iterates through a list and applies a given function to each link

resulting from this

* ft_prodvect returns the cross product of two 3d vectors
* ft_putchar prints a given char to the standard file descriptor
* ft_putchar_fd pritns a given char to a given file descriptor
* ft_putendl prints a string to the standard file descriptor
* ft_putendl_fd prints a string to a given file_descriptor
* ft_putnbr prints an integer to the standar file descriptor
* ft_putnbr_fd prints an integer to a given file descriptor
* ft_putstr prints a string to the standard file descriptor
* ft_putstr_fd prints a string to a given file descriptor
* ft_scalevect multipliess a 3d vector by a given value
* ft_setvect sets the values of a 3d vector
* ft_sign returns 1 if the given number is positive or null and -1 if negative
* ft_split returns an array of strings created separating the given string using the delimiters received
* ft_sqrt returns the square root of an integer if there is one
* ft_strcat has the same behavior as strcat from the libc
* ft_strchr has the same behavior strchr from the libc
* ft_strclr sets every character from a srting to '\0'
* ft_strcmp has the same behavior as strcmp from the libc
* ft_strcpy has the same behavior as strcpy from the libc
* ft_strdel frees a string a sets its pointer to NULL
* ft_strdup has the same behavior as strdup from the libc
* ft_strequ compares two strings and returns 1 if they are identical, or 0 otherwise
* ft_striter iterates through a string and applies a function to each character
* ft_strjoin allocates a new string resulting from the concatenation of two strings
* ft_strlcat has the same behavior as strlcat from the libc
